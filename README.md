# FDTD 3D GPU
Accelerated parallel FDTD code in the GPU.

Although the execution speed of serial code in the CPU is slower than that of parallel code in the GPU, pay attention to some points in MATLAB programming such as avoiding For loop and avoiding array indexing improves the code execution speed.
